      <p>Hello,this is Assignment 1 of Day 2!!!</p>

          //QUESTION 1
            console.log(1+"2"+"2");         
                //OUTPUT:122    
                     //REASON:1 is a numerical value whereas the next two are strings,hence '+' concatenates the values
            console.log(1+ +"2"+"2");     
                //OUTPUT:32    
                     //REASON:The first two values are added(as the second value is prefixed with '+',it supports addition and not concatemnation),the third value is considered string here and concatenated to the value obtained from the first two values
            console.log(1+ -"1"+"2");       
                 //OUTPUT:02
                    //REASON:Second value is evaluated as -1 as minus performs only subtraction in all languages including javascript,hence the first two values are evaluated as 0 and third value is concatenated as a string to the evaluated value
            console.log(+"1"+"1"+"2");    
                //OUTPUT:112
                    //REASON:All three values are evaluated as strings and hence the output is a result of concatenation
            console.log("A"-"B"+"2");       
                //OUTPUT:NaN2
                    //REASON:Arithmetic operations cannot be performed on Strings hence "A" and "B" results in non-defined value NaN and the third value "2" is concatnated to the obtained NaN value
            console.log("A"-"B"+2);      
               //OUTPUT:NaN
                     //REASON:Arithmetic operations cannot be performed on Strings hence "A" and "B" results in non-defined value NaN and third numerical value doesn't support addition to the undefined value

           
                
            //QUESTION 2
           var marks=19;
